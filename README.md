Features
--------

* Easily capture screenshots for Android and iOS.
* Video record real android devices. (OS > 4.4)
	* Extend recording past the 180 seconds SDK limit.
* Save video formats in mp4 or gif.
* Flick auto detects if a device is recordable.
	* Falls back to screenshot recording if video record is not available.
* Video record android emulators and **real** iOS devices.
	* Takes a screenshot every 0.5 seconds (default), then combines the screenshots into a single mp4 or gif.
	* Android pulls only unique (default) screenshots from devices/emulators. e.g. A 1 minute test run might convert to only 30 seconds of video based on unique images. You can change this by passing `-q false` to pull all images instead.
	* iOS example [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pjhhmnsx9gj5pi/ios-flick-example.mp4?dl=0)
	* Android Emulator example [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwunrvgzxkny13z/android-flick-example.mp4?dl=0)
* Flick auto selects device when only one device is connected, per platform.
* Save log output for Android or iOS.
* Display device information or save it to a file.
* Install or Uninstall applications from devices.
* Capture device vitals (Android Only) for app and system performance. 
   * If anyone knows of a tool to capture performance for iOS please let me know and I'll add it to Flick.
* Checkout the latest release notes [here](https://github.com/isonic1/flick/releases).

Reason
------
I wanted an easy way to video record my automation tests for mobile, and I didn't need the video quality to be perfect. Unfortunately, you cannot video record on android emulators, but you can take screenshots! You also cannot video record iOS without using QuickTime, or doing what [this](https://github.com/appium/screen_recording) did, but it's not maintained anymore.

So I created Flick to work for my needs, and included a couple other tools I use frequently. Hopefully this will be as helpful for others too. It's also a CLI and language-agnostic, it can be used with any framework where you can make a system call. See examples [here](https://github.com/isonic1/appium-mobile-grid/blob/flick/ios/spec/spec_helper.rb#L15-L16) and [here](https://github.com/isonic1/appium-mobile-grid/blob/flick/android/spec/spec_helper.rb#L22-L23). I suppose there are use cases for this outside of test automation. I'd love to hear them if so.

If you're looking for high-quality video, then this wouldn't be the tool for you. Take a look at this great tool [androidtool-mac](https://github.com/mortenjust/androidtool-mac) instead.

Prerequisites
-------------
#### System Tools
* Install ffmpeg. [OSX](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/MacOSX)
	* ```$ brew install ffmpeg```
* Install mp4box. [OSX](http://hunterford.me/compiling-mp4box-on-mac-os-x/)
	* ```$ brew install mp4box```

#### Android
* Install [SDK Tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools).
* SDK tools are added to your $PATH. [OSX](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5526470/trying-to-add-adb-to-path-variable-osx)
* Enable [USB Debugging](https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm) on your device(s).
* Emulator or Devices have approximately 1GB of [sdcard space](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/mksdcard.html).

#### iOS
* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).
* Install Xcode [Command Line Tools](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html).
* Enable [Developer Mode](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/159196/enable-developer-inside-the-settings-app-on-ios) on iPhone or iPad devices.
* Install [libimobiledevice](http://www.libimobiledevice.org/).
	* ```$ brew install libimobiledevice```

#### Known Issues
* IOS:
   * Sometimes ideviceinstaller gets out of sync with your OS due to various reasons. When this happens, screenshots and video will not work for iOS.
      * Follow steps in [here](https://github.com/isonic1/flick/issues/10) to uninstall and reinstall dependencies.
      * Make sure xcode and command line tools are up to date.
      * Make sure iOS device is up to date with latest iOS version.
      * Validate your device is paired to your machine. `$ idevicepair -u <udid> validate`
      * Additionally, try to unpair and pair again.
         * `$ idevicepair -u <udid> unpair`
         * `$ idevicepair -u <udid> pair` Accept the Trust popup on the device.

* Android:
   * Some devices/emulators are read-only. Flick requires access to internal storage of the device/emulator to write files to. If the device is read-only it cannot do this so it will Abort. There is probably a solution to this but I, unfortunately, don't have a lot of time to figure it out. Pull Requests are highly encouragaged if you find this tool useful!

* Setup Flick android for cross platform os's (windows & linux)
* Add screenshot capture for iOS Simulators.
* Multithread the screenshot and pull process.
* Look into capturing video for iOS similar to [this](https://github.com/mortenjust/androidtool-mac/blob/9347cd9aeca9e7370e323d12f862bc5d8beacc25/AndroidTool/IOSDeviceHelper.swift#L56)
